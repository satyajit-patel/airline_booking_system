# Airline Reservation System

## Description
The objective of this project is to design and develop an airline reservation system. The primary function would be to enable a customer to book airline tickets. It will allow the customer to make bookings/search for flights through different ways such as by choosing the convenient source and destination places or by favorable dates. It shall also enable the user
to modify his/her bookings. This system will be a real-time system, and the pricing of the tickets will vary with time. Each new customer will be required to make a login account with their details, which enables them to reach the booking stage. The same account can be used again for future bookings.

It was an interesting project to explore microservices as I was able to see logical separation of modules.
Also a booking system is good to learn transactional data handling in rdbms.
I explored repository pattern and service layers along with autoscaling as microservices allow us to scale up individual services whenever reqd.
